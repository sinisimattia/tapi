# Contribution guidelines

Here's a short guide for contributing to the project.

## For pull requests
### Be clean
Make sure to always clean your code before submitting,
you can do it automatically with `npm run clean`, or by hand
by running `npm run lint` and then checking manually.

If the clean command throws errors you won't be able to merge.

### Write unit tests
If introducing a new feature, be sure to include thorough unit
tests, so that the intended behavior is as clear as possible.
A better approach would be to write the test BEFORE starting
the actual implementation.

### Ask for code reviews
Please include me as a reviewer. That's it.

## For issues and pull requests

### Use the correct tags
Yeah... the tags help us organize issues and PRs so...

### Proper references
Be sure to properly include references to issues and pull requests
in comments, descriptions and commits whenever possible.
