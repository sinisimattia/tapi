## Imagine doing this...

![Demo Example with Axios](https://i.ibb.co/stfLH8B/tepi-demo.png)

## What is it?

**tapi** is a tiny TypeScript package used to define how to interpret any given API response as a typed object.

It **automatically** converts JSON objects into TypeScript class instances, however you can still configure it however you want with *Aliases*, *Transformers*, *Mappers* and more.
